# Project Name

The To-Do App

## Description

I will be creating a 'TO DO' application. My application will allow users to create a task that will be stored inside of a SQL database. When the task has been created the page will refresh showing all tasks that now need to be completed. I will be creating buttons to 'Complete' or 'Delete' the tasks shown. When a user clicks 'Complete' the task will be checked off, and will now be displayed in green, (as completed). The task will be stored in the database whether it has been completed or not, but when the user clicks 'Delete' it will be deleted from the database.
